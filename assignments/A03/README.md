### Definitions

#### Class

#### Object

#### Method
> A function inside a class.  Can either be public or private.

#### Abstraction

> It serves to make things easier for humans to interpret and work with.

#### Encapsulation
> Encapsulation is used to refer to one of two different notions.

#### Polymorphism
> Polymorphism is the use of a single symbol to represent several different types.

#### Overloading
> Overloading is when you make multiple functions or methods with the same name or symbol, but with different parameters, so they can be called independently.

#### Attributes/properties
> Attributes or properties form a heirarchy of classes.  They are elements of a class which can be passed down to other classes by inheritance.

#### Class Variable
> A variable defined in a class that there can only be one of, no matter how many instances of the class are created.

#### Instance Variable
> A variable defined in a class where each instance of the class will have its own copy of the variable.

#### Member Variable
> A variable defined in a class that is associated with a specific object, and accessible for all its methods.

#### Inheritance
> Inheritance is the act of passing attributes from one class down to another.

#### Multiple Inheritance
> MMultiple inheritance is where one class can have more than one child class and inherit features from all parent classes.

#### Composition
> The act of combining multiple simple types to make a more complex one.
